About:
there are ingame tutorial that will help you with getting familiar with the buttons
in this game you can kill monsters depending on your lvl (higher lvl > get stronger > need more exp to lvl > stronger monsters with better exp rates )
you can lvl up by killing and gaining exp and upgrade your stats
you have hp that monsters can kill you and mp that drains with every skill used so use potions carefully
pick up messos from monsters buy items in the shop and go back into action
there are few skills you can use , the skills get upgraded when you upgrade your stats (in the stats tab)
